# üìö Algorithms for Massive Data (DSE) ‚Äì Project

This repository contains my **course project** for **Algorithms for Massive Data (DSE)**.  
The project focuses on analyzing and finding similarities between large-scale book reviews using **PySpark** and text similarity algorithms.

---

## üìå Project Overview
The aim of this project is to apply **algorithms for massive data** to real-world text data (Amazon Book Reviews) and study different methods for similarity detection.

### Objectives:
1. Explore and preprocess large-scale text data.  
2. Apply **Shingling** and **Jaccard similarity** for text comparison.  
3. Investigate scalable methods such as **MinHash** and **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**.  
4. Evaluate algorithm performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy on large data.
